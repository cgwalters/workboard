# OS upgrade I/O competes with etcd

Currently the MCD does:

- drain
- apply updates
- reboot

Now "drain" keeps both daemonsets and static pods running.  Of those two, etcd is a static pod today.  When we're applying OS updates, that can be a lot of I/O and (reportedly) compete with etcd.

We have two options:

1. kill etcd after draining (or even more strongly, stop kubelet)
1. "stage" updates gracefully while everything is running

I like option 2) better because we've put a *whole lot* of work into making the ostree stack support this "stage updates while system is running" and it'd be cool if OpenShift used it :smile:   Another way to say this is - I think we want to minimize the time window in which the etcd cluster is missing a member, so the more work we can do while etcd is still running the better!
